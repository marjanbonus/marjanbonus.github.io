I usually like to come back alive from kayaking. It goes without saying that safety is paramount here.

## In general

Knowing how to do a <strong>wet exit</strong>, <strong>bracing</strong>, <strong>self rescue</strong> and <strong>to roll</strong> your kayak are some of the most important things regarding safety.
Someone will say that having a wetsuit and know how to do wet exit will be enough, but will you dare to go paddling a little bit further from the shore?
With these technigues, you will have more self-confidence when you are paddling alone, going on longer distances or dealing with the waves.

One thing that goes before them all is to use your brain, be able to recognize dangerous situation and <strong>stay out of trouble</strong>, because it's much easier than dealing with a trouble.

Although <strong>wet exits</strong> from this ocean - smaller type Greenlandic cockpits are much easier than entering the same, you should learn this with a friend next to you, so you can get assistance if something goes wrong. Once you know how to do it, you will feel safer and with more self-confidence. Another step is rolling. :)
<strong>Learning to roll</strong> is much easier with having a good instructor next to you, or at least someone who will assist you if you fail with your roll. If you know <strong>wet exit</strong> you can practise rolls alone but it's worst case scenario because it can get a little bit frustrating doing wet exit, dumping water and reentering your kayak on every failed roll (my scenario).
<strong>Do not</strong> practise this on river (moving water) or too shallow water for safety reasons.


Whether you are on the <strong>river or the sea</strong>, there are always <strong>dangers you need to be aware of</strong>.
What cames first to my mind while paddling <strong>rivers</strong> is to stay away from <strong>log jams</strong>. They usually can be found on outer parts of river bend and river where I'am paddling the most (river Drava) has them plenty. River is mostly deeper and faster on outside bends and with erosion, logs can accumulate on these parts. If you are not experienced you could end up in logs and if you stuck here by accident, current is strong and you could end up underneath the logs. Bye. Stay away of these river parts and better paddle inside river bends where current is slower.
Although I do not have any experience with river dams, low-head dams create powerful recirculating currents that can trap and drown even experienced kayakers. Avoid them.

<strong>Shallow water drowning.</strong> You may think you are save in shallow water if you are outside of your kayak, but if this water is fast, it's better not to stand on river bottom. If your leg stuck somewhere by accident, strong river flow will submerge you. In these situations, better swim completely to the shore without touching river bottom.

<strong>Sea</strong> 
You should be even more cautious when paddling at the sea.

Check the weather forecast and winds. What wave size can you handle? There are waves generated in distant weather systems and they will be present even if there is no local wind.
On larger waves keep the distance from shore. Waves could crush you and your kayak onto rocks.


<strong>Wear a PFD</strong>, in 99% of situations you will not need one, but you should wear it always because of this one percent of situations.

<strong>Dress for immersion</strong>, according to water temperature and hypothermia prevention. Google it.

Skin on frame kayaks do not have air chamber so it's good to have <strong>float bags</strong> which will add additional buoyancy and reduce amount of water which can get in the kayak. <strong>Gear dry bags</strong> will also help. There are float bags which are made for kayak stems out there. I use pull cord (from cockpit to stems, installed during frame build) in all of my kayaks for easier install, so you can pull dry bag to stems.

## Self rescoue in a skin on frame kayak

Here is my video (at the bottom) where I'm showing self rescue in my totally submerged West Greenland skin on frame kayak. This one is my recent build, LOA 520cm, beam 53cm and it weights 12kg. :)
I forgot to take my bilge pump with me, but with this method, there is so <strong>little water</strong> left in a kayak that it does not affect its stability, so you can continue with paddling to shore safely in order to remove the rest of water with sponge or use a bilge pump.

Kayak full of water will be the rare case, but it can be seen how fast it can be done. It's a little bit harder if you are not standing on the ground but as you can see, it can be done with a little bit of leg work. :) It's easier to do this with additional buoyancy, so here is <strong>one more reason to wear a PFD</strong>.

This type of self rescue is for <strong>unloaded kayak</strong>, although with these low volume kayaks that I use mostly for one day paddling it's also managable to do it if you are not carying too much things (I mostly do it with one 5 liter dry bag with personal things and snacks, and a bottle or two of drinking water)

It is good to practice in the conditions you will paddle. I'm just saying, because you could confront wind or waves. From the same reason, it is good to know this rescue without diving mask or nose clips. In case you have hard times with sea water and your nose (although it's good for your nasal passages), exhaling gently through the nose while upside down / blowing bubbles, can help prevent water from entering the nose.

This type of rescue is actually easy because of Greenland paddle. If you know wet exit and to enter your kayak with using Greenland paddle as an outrigger, you are on more than a half way to to this rescue. This 'cowboy' straddling is easy once you know to use your paddle as an outrigger.

At the end, there is always risk involved with an advanture but knowing more about safety and different technigues that can save you will reduce that risk.
