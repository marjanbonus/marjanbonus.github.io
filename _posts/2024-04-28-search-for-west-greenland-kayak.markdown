Greenland Kayak. Built by indigenous people of Greenland to hunt and survive in rough sea conditions.

## Study

I live in Europe, where 'skin on frame' type of construction is not so common, so books were my main source of informations. 
At first, I found an excellent guide for building a Greenlandic Kayak - <strong>'Instruction in Kayak Building'</strong> by <strong>H.C. Petersen</strong>. This book has very nice and straight explanations on Greenlandic kayak construction. It also has some info on sheer line and hull type but I wanted to know more about these topics as I've seen so much different Grenlandic kayaks. I got one more great book <strong>'Building the Greenland Kayak'</strong> by <strong>Christopher Cunningham</strong>. This book is full of step by step informations on how to build Greenlandic kayak but besides that, it can be learned a lot about working with the wood in general and tools which will be of great help. Building the Greenland paddle, tuilik, spray skirt, knots... are some of interesting topics too. In short, must have book.

While reading the books I already had two long straight 'gunwale' planks and various forms with different angles for toying with their angle in order to find out which sheer line I like the best. Cunningham works with less sheer (straighter sheer) in order to get the kayak which will have good tracking. This actually bothered me as I wanted to get good tracking but also found out that I really like to see more sheer in kayaks, lets say a little of 'banana' look at center of kayak but with low bow and stern ends, so I knew that I'll need to create my own rib measurement system in order to get correct hull type with good tracking.

Later, I found out about <strong>Harvey Golden</strong> and his book <strong>'Kayaks of Greenland'</strong> which analyzes history and development of the Greenlandic Hunting Kayak (1600-2000). This book was pure gold for me. There are so many details in this book and you can actually see how these kayaks evolved through the years and how they are built from region to region. I finally realized how 'Greenlandic kayak' is very broad term.

Despite many beautiful kayaks from all regions of Greenland, Central West (late 1800s through present), Northwest (Disko Bay and North, late 19th through 20th century) and East Greenland (20th century) kayaks (from ‘Kayaks of Greenland’ by Harvey Golden) were the most attractive to me. I wanted a little bit lower volume kayak that would be nice for rolling too, but East Greenland kayaks were simply of too much (claustrophobic) low volume for me, so I decided to go with something in between East and Central West - Disko Bay models, more precisely 1927-1928 & 1931 as my main inspiration.

In comparison to the rest, these kayaks were a bit shorter and with <strong>lower sheer</strong>. <strong>Cockpit</strong> on these models is usually <strong>aft of center</strong> which will reduce <strong>weather cocking</strong>. Usually larger space between ribs at seating position in order not to disturb thighs underneath.

As most of Greenland kayaks had small beam (breadth), I decided not to go with any type of floorboards or seat but with the foam pad. In order to get more on <strong>stability</strong> because of kayak width, center of gravity should be as low as possible. Christopher Cunningham writes in his 'Building The Greenland Kayak': 'Floorboards were not common among traditional Greenland kayaks. If the ribs are properly spaced so you are not sitting directly on one or resting your heels on one, the seat is fairly comfortable with just the addition of a hide or foam pad'.

Because of <strong>hard chined</strong> 'V' bottom hull it should have good <strong>secondary</strong> (edge) stability and because of flatter ribs underneath paddler and aft, lower deadrise angle should improve <strong>primary</strong> stability too.

Flat (no) rocker at stern should improve tracking and additionally prevent weather cocking, but with noticeable bow rocker which I decided to keep it because of manoeuvrability especially when edging.

Other books that I found out later and want to mention because they were nice reads too are <strong>'Eastern Arctic Kayaks'</strong> by <strong>John D. Heath</strong> and <strong>E. Arima</strong> and <strong>'Building Skin-On-Frame Boats'</strong> by <strong>Robert Morris</strong>.
