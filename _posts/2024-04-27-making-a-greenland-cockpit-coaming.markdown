A strong wooden hoop that forms kayak cockpit. Greenland coaming is not fastened to kayak frame but laced with the amiq (skin) through coaming lacing holes.

Coaming is created with steam bent oak. Although possible to bend it with freehand, bending form is used in order to get a nicer shape. 

The shapes of these forms are similar to an egg. It's actually made with experimenting, so something flexible in your workshop can really help here. Bandsaw blade turned out to be excellent for the job. Once you get desired shape at one side, the rest is easy. A few spots are translated from one side to another and connected with bandsaw blade.

At the right, figure 115. (from 'Kayaks of Greenland' by Harvey Golden) shows more common coaming shapes among Greenland Kayaks. Selected shape was something in between triangular and oval which should give a little bit more room for back and hips than oval or round.

Most of traditional Greenland kayaks did not have coaming edge to hold spray deck. "Some had a short stick bent along the back of the coaming or short cleats to form a lip that held the back of a spray skirt or tuilik, but a tightly tied drawcord usually held them on the coaming" (Christopher Cunningham, 'Building the Greenland Kayak'). For modern spray decks with elastic bungees, edge around the entire coaming became necessary.

Slavonia (region of Croatia) has always had a good oak. The best tradional fishing boats which can be seen on Drava and Danube river were actually built from it as it was extremly rot resistant.
With compression strap and soaking it in water for a few days (if it's kiln dried) it's possible to get a nice curves without cracking.
Magic usually starts to happen when a steam box temperature of 80Â°C is reached and wood is steamed for an hour per 2.5cm of thickness.

When the coaming is bent over the form and scarf joints fastened with PU glue, coaming edge is bent around coaming and secured with bronce screws. Bronce has resistance to corrosion and its darker color blends nicely with the oak.

Once the coaming is correctly positioned over Masik (Greenlandic word for main curved deck beam and cockpit forward end) and Isserfik (cockpit aft-end deck beam) it's ready for lacing with the skin.

It should be noted that these Greenland coamings were small. If the width of the coaming is observed, H.C. Petersen in his 'Instruction in Kayak Building' book writes "The external diameter of the hoop is determined by the width of the kayak. It must be 10cm less than the width of the kayak". Looking at historical Greenlandic kayak drawings by Harvey Golden from his 'Kayaks of Greenland', it can be seen that H.C. Petersen statement is actually very true, as most of coamings were in this ballpark.
Inner coaming length is usually slightly bigger than width. In comparison with historical examples, I've increased it slightly (around 3cm), but you can't actually increase it too much because of correct Masik position in order to have a nice tight fit and contact of Masik with your upper knee leg part.

Interestingly, Greenland hunting kayaks often had coamings slightly offset to right or left depending on whether the hunter was right-handed or left-handed, as centered coaming was poor working position for the hunter (H. C. Petersen, 1986).
