It's worth mentioning that every type of urethane, even UV resistant one, will degrade on the sun with prolonged exposure. Same goes for composite or plastic kayaks, plus they can deform too. Keep your kayak <strong>out of the sun</strong> in <strong>dry place</strong> when you are not paddling it and this will prolong it's life. <strong>Garage</strong> would be a nice place. Backyard would be fine too, but putting some type of roof over it would be good. It's good to leave cockpit open so the air can circulate through it.

Skin on frame kayaks are <strong>not susceptible to rotting</strong>, although these kayaks have its frame covered with <strong>decking oil</strong> just in case. They do not spend all their life in water like boats. Frame is made this way that only small part of it is in touch with the skin, so the water is not retained in between. Although, there are few things required for rot. Prolonged exposure to moisture, oxygen and specific temperature.

I made this stand for my kayaks so once the kayak is in this position (picture), all the water (if present) will be accumulated near the cockpit. It's very easy to remove it with the sponge this way.

<strong>Remove the water</strong> from your kayak (it will be dry very fast this way), keep it in <strong>dry place</strong> and <strong>out of the sun</strong> after kayaking. It will last for a long time this way.

## Protection

Most of abrasion happens where skin touches the frame. That would be the keelson and chines. I usually make oak strips (soaked in tung oil) and attach them with A4 inox screws to keelson ends / stems.
Although there are also some historical kayak examples which had protections on chines too, I do not put them on my kayaks.

## Skin on frame thoughness and durability

Can this translucent skin be durable? 
![skin_on_frame_toughness](/assets/images/posts/skin-on-frame-kayak-care/tough.jpg)

Well, yes. I've made separate blog [The Skin - 'Amiq']({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-10-03-the-skin.markdown %}) where the skin material is described a little bit better.
In combination with good urethane coating (with good flexibility and abrasion resistance), these boats become quite tough.

It's hard to compare with other types of kayaks but with flexible skin, these kayaks 'absorb' impacts. They have great impact resistance, probably best of all kayak types. 

On the other side, although they are more than enough resistant to abrasion, plastic kayak would be a winner here. You can haul it through sand and rocks without worry and most you will get are surface scrathes from rocks, but with kayak weight of 12-13kg you can easily carry it with one hand.
On the other hand, very sharp rocks or oyster could make a puncture. That's why skin on frame kayaks are nice for sea, river or lake, but they are not for whitewater.

I tried to make a puncture with screwdriver and I did not made it. I would not go in details with my tests because it's simple not a real life situation. There is a big difference when you hit sharp object in moving water with all of your weight.
Urethane coating that I use at the moment is nice, UV resistant and with good flexibility but it's one component alkyd urethane and repeated abrasion is not so great for it after my tests. That is something I'm constantl working on and I'll probably switch to something a little bit different soon.

Greenlanders reskinned their kayaks every year or two. The seal skin was rotting so it was needed to do it. With modern materials of today, situation is much different. At the end, once the skin is all beaten up, with reskinning of kayak, you get a new kayak. That is something you can do it yourself and I'll make a separate post about it.

## Repairs

For quick / on the water repairs I always bring with myself few meters of duck tape, although I did not need it so far.
Punctures can be sealed with urethane or SMP (MS Polymer) based sealants. I experimented a little bit and Bison Poly Max high tack express is a good one.
It will stick good to urethane but keep in mind that urethane alkyd (and robably most urethanes) varnish will not cure well if you covering it over SMP based sealant.

I'm mentioning this because maybe you would like to do it with urethane varnish. If you go this route, better to slightly sand the place with puncture and apply few urethane coatings
directly over it without sealant. Urethane alkyd varnish is usually thick enough to cover a small punctures.
I'm in constant search for better coating options on the market so I'll give more details about it once I settle down with it, because not all urethanes will stick good on already cured urethane coating.

Worst case scenario would be tear in the skin. It happens very rarely and I haven't heard of it happening to anyone. In this case, it would be needed to stitch this place with curved upholstery needle and fishing braided line before applying urethane/sealant.
