Back in the old days the covering of Greenland kayaks was mostly done with seal skin. H.C. Petersen in his 'Instruction in Kayak Building' writes: "...when the seal population of Greenland began to decline at the begining of the present century, it became difficult for many hunters to get hold of the required number of suitable kayak-skins. More and more hunters have therefore started to cover their kayaks with canvas or duck".


## Modern Fabrics

With invention of modern materials, polyester and nylon (polyamide) became two most used materials because of lightness, strength, abrasion resistance and rot resistance. Both of materials have its pros and cons.

### Polyester
A little bit better in uv resistance but it's less abrasion resistant than nylon and most of coatings will stick to it without a problem. It can be tricky to work with because it will not stretch like nylon so it's harder to apply it nicely in order to follow kayak curves and you could get wrinkles but this is resolved by shrinking it with an iron. That said, if you look for polyester fabric, you should find one which is not preshrunk!

### Nylon
To be precise, ballistic nylon. It's developed by the DuPont corporation as a material for bulletproof vests in WW2 with great abrasion and puncture resistance. It's nice to work with as it follows kayak curves because of its stretchiness. Next to greater abrasion resistance, this stretchiness is actually the second important reason why I choose nylon. It will simply better absorb hits if it's stricken with something. More on downsides, it's hygroscopic, so it can relax a little bit on humid and cold weather so you get loose skin in these conditions. This effect mainly disappears over time but in order to prevent this it's important to tighten it correctly around the frame, even sewing fabric on wet if needed. Not every coating will stick to it, but oil based urethanes will do the trick and most of these will have a good UV resistance too. So, if applied correctly, these downsides can be omitted.

USA has more of skin on frame kayak builders so the choice of materials too.
Skin material was actually my main problem because I wanted to find 'my skin' and Europe was perfect place where you don't have to look for it!

## Tests

After too many emails with various fabric companies and too many fabric samples I finally found it. I wanted in this blog to provide all my tests of different fabric types at first but I changed my mind because it would take eternity and most of materials were not so good so I'll try to explain the results in short.

I tested <strong>polyamide woven fabrics</strong>. So what's exactly ballistic nylon? Polyamide fabric woven with basket/panama type of weave and yarn which is smooth. Ballistic nylon from one German store is strong but of very loose weave, so once you start tightening it around frame you will get large pull holes which can be sealed but with applying more strength these holes open even more and this is something what concerns me. I've tested one more similar german fabric with nearly identical results. Further, Cordura classic (developed and trademarked by DuPont) polyamide 6.6 fabric woven with plain wave is superb material which is very similar to ballistic in strength and abrasion resistance but the biggest problem is that it's made with ATY (air textured yarn) so surface is a little bit fluffy or hairy and this creates problems during urethane coating so you can't get smooth surface.

<strong>Finally</strong>, fabric that I've found to be the best for my needs is nylon 66 fabric with durable rib weave. Depending on batch, it has width of cca 165 cm and weights cca 270 g/m² and woven with yarn of 470dtex. Dtext? In short, weight of fabric yarn. So if compared to lets say 1100dtex fabric, it has much less strength? Yes, if both materials have same number of threads/cm but this is tightly woven fabric with most threads/cm of all fabrics that I've tested. Having said that, its tensile strength for warp/weft goes over 4000N/3000N (ISO 13934-1) what is actually stronger than Cordura classic 1100dtex in 260 g/m² (warp/weft over 3200N/2300N ISO 13934-1) and similar strength of one german ballistic nylon that I've tested in 940dtex / 290 g/m² (warp/weft over 4500N/4000N / ISO 13934-1). Why nylon 66? Nylon 6 and 66 are two most commonly used synthetic polymers known as polyamides. Nylon 66 is 33% more resistant to abrasion than nylon 6, it has higher melting point, higher heat deflection temperature, lower water absorption rate and better chemical resistance to acids.

Because of tighter weave, this fabric can be hard pulled during tightening of fabric with thread and while sewing. Pull holes? Yes, it's something what it's normal because fabric is not fixated with coating yet. You will get acceptable pull holes and most important holes will not be much bigger if extreme force is applied. I always use sealer for these holes anyway. It's hard to describe details here by words but I'll explain this more in my 'sewing the skin' blog with provided detailed images.
Speaking about colors, I do not know how it will accept acid dyes because I'm not using ones. I cover the skin with earth pigments only.
