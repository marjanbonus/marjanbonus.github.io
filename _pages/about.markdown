Man Boat crafts traditional <strong>skin on frame kayaks</strong> using techniques passed down through generations of Arctic builders. These kayaks combine the lightweight flexibility of a wooden frame with the durability of modern synthetic skins, creating vessels that are both seaworthy and beautiful.
<br />
These boats honor the ingenious design principles developed by Inuit and other indigenous peoples, adapted with contemporary materials and construction methods. Every frame is hand-lashed using polyester thread, while the nylon skin is carefully stretched and fitted for optimal performance on the water.
<br />
Whether you're seeking a <strong>low-volume</strong> day-trip or a <strong>touring</strong> kayak, these kayaks offer character and performance. Each boat is built to order, ensuring a perfect fit for your paddling style and adventure goals.
